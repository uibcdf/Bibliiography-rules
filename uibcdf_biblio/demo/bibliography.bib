abstract = {Virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) in drug discovery is a powerful approach to identify hits: when applied successfully, it can be much faster and cheaper than experimental high-throughput screening approaches. However, mainstream vHTS tools have significant limitations: ligand-based methods depend on knowledge of existing chemical matter, while structure-based tools such as docking involve significant approximations that limit their accuracy. Recent advances in scientific methods coupled with dramatic speedups in computational processing with GPUs make this an opportune time to consider the role of more rigorous methods that could improve the predictive power of vHTS workflows. In this Perspective, we assert that alchemical binding free energy methods using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have matured to the point where they can be applied in virtual screening campaigns as a final scoring stage to prioritize the top molecules for experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations offer the most direct and computationally efficient approach within a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework for computing binding energies of diverse molecules, as is required for virtual screening. ABFE calculations are particularly attractive for drug discovery at this point in time, where the confluence of large-scale genomics data and insights from chemical biology have unveiled a large number of promising disease targets for which no small molecule binders are known, precluding ligand-based approaches, and where traditional docking approaches have foundered to find progressible chemical matter.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the Free Energy Landscape topology is the essential key to understanding many biochemical processes. The determination of the conformers of a protein and their basins of attraction takes a central role for studying molecular isomerization reactions. In this work, we present a novel framework to unveil the features of a Free Energy Landscape answering questions such as how many meta-stable conformers there are, what the hierarchical relationship among them is, or what the structure and kinetics of the transition paths are. Exploring the landscape by molecular dynamics simulations, the microscopic data of the trajectory are encoded into a Conformational Markov Network. The structure of this graph reveals the regions of the conformational space corresponding to the basins of attraction. In addition, handling the Conformational Markov Network, relevant kinetic magnitudes as dwell times and rate constants, or hierarchical relationships among basins, completes the global picture of the landscape. We show the power of the analysis studying a toy model of a funnel-like potential and computing efficiently the conformers of a short peptide, dialanine, paving the way to a systematic study of the Free Energy Landscape in large peptides.},

abstract = {Free energy calculations play an essential role in the study of physical transformations and chemical reactions. Within the universe of free energy calculation applications, solvation free energies (Gsolv) have a leading role: they are easy to calculate and have a broad scope of applications, from the study distribution coefficients between two phases to solubility prediction. This dissertation discusses some of the uses of Gsolv as a tool for method development, as a way to calculate infinite dilution activity coefficients, and as a part of an effort to predict solubilities of molecular solids. In chapters 2 and 3, I discuss the general features of solvation free energy calculations and their applications. We also introduced an update of FreeSolv, a hydration free energy database, and the use of infinite activity coefficient calculations (IDACs) as assisting tools (or potentially substitutes) of hydration free energies in force field parameterization and method development. Chapter 4 discusses the reproducibility of relative alchemical free energies (RAFE) across different software (AMBER, GROMACS, SOMD, CHARMM). We demonstrated that Ghyd can be reproduced to within about +0.2 kcal /mol and we highlighted the differences and particularities of each code. I was responsible for running the simulations and analyzing the results of the GROMACS code. Chapter 5 discusses an application of free energy calculations to the prediction of solubilities. I attempted to predict the solubility of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) by calculating the absolute chemical potentials of the most stable polymorph of ASA and of solutions of different concentrations. Despite not finding a result that agreed with experimental error, I outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the method used and suggested improvements for future attempts. Main Content},

@article{Eastman2017OpenMM,
abstract = {OpenMM is a molecular dynamics simulation toolkit with a unique focus on extensibility. It allows users to easily add new features, including forces with novel functional forms, new integration algorithms, and new simulation protocols. Those features automatically work on all supported hardware types (including both CPUs and GPUs) and perform well on all of them. In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM. This makes it an ideal tool for researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new methods to be immediately available to the larger community.},

abstract = {In this paper, the Turing instability in reaction-diffusion models defined on complex networks is studied. Here, we focus on three types of models which generate complex networks, i.e. the Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s-R$\backslash$'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz and the threshold network models. From analysis of the Laplacian matrices of graphs generated by these models, we reveal that the stable-unstable regions of a spatially homogeneous solution completely differ, depending on network structures. In particular, we approximately argue the existence of the stable-unstable regions in the cases of regular enhanced ring lattices which include regular circles, and networks generated by the threshold network model when the number of vertices is large enough.},
