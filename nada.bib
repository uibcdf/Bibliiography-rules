    abstract = {This section reviews the relation between the continuous dynamics of a molecular system in thermal equilibrium and the kinetics given by a Markov State Model (MSM). We will introduce the dynamical propagator, an error-less, alternative description of the continuous dynamics, and show how MSMs result from its discretization. This allows for an precise understanding of the approximation quality of MSMs in comparison to the continuous dynamics. The results on the approximation quality are key for the design of good MSMs. While this section is important for understanding the theory of discretization and related systematic errors, practitioners wishing only to learn how to construct MSMs may skip directly to the discussion of Markov model estimation.

To achieve rapid identification of new lead compounds, high-throughput screening assays have been employed in many pharmaceutical companies and laboratories. However, their success depends on the assay system relevant to in vivo conditions and they are physically limited by the repertoire of compounds. As an alternative or complementary approach to high-throughput screening assays, virtual screening is an efficient method to identify drug candidates in silico from large chemical compound databases. Its usefulness has been verified by current applications that successfully retrieved hit and lead identifications against various disease targets. However, for better application, the scoring functions for distinguishing possible active and inactive compounds must beimproved. Areas covered in this review: In this review, we provide an overview of pharmacophore-based virtual screening methods with a special focus on their successful application towards finding hits against various diseasetargets. What the reader will gain: Readers will rapidly gain insight into the recent successful applications of pharmacophore-based virtual screening. They will acknowledge that this technique is a powerful and cost-effective alternative to high-throughput assays. Take home message: Although there are many hurdles yet to be resolved, virtual screening techniques will emerge as essential infrastructure and as a prerequisite for developing new lead compounds with therapeuticapplications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",

    abstract = {For over a century since the early 1900s, Paul Ehrlich was credited with originating the concept of pharmacophores. This was challenged by John Van Drie in 2007 due to the fact that Ehrlich did not use the word " pharmacophore" in his writings. Van Drie claimed that the attribution of the pharmacophore concept to Ehrlich was due to an erroneous citation made by Ari{\"{e}}ns in a 1966 paper, and instead he claimed, Lemont B. Kier developed the pharmacophore concept (in the modern sense, as defined by the IUPAC) during 1967-1971. There are two separate issues that may have triggered this conflict. The first one is the shift in the meaning of pharmacophore from "chemical groups" to patterns of "abstract features" of a molecule that are responsible for a biological effect. Indeed, the original use of the term is different than the current definition proposed by the IUPAC. The term was redefined in 1960 by Schueler, and this modification formed the basis of IUPAC's modern definition. The second issue is the origin of the "concept" of pharmacophore. While Ehrlich's contemporaries have consistently attributed the origin of the concept to him, the issue is further complicated by the fact that Ehrlich did not use the term pharmacophore in his papers. He, instead, referred to the features of a molecule that are responsible for biological effects as toxophores, while his contemporaries were using the term pharmacophore for the same features. In this paper, we resolve any doubts about the origins of the pharmacophore concept. Our research points to Paul Ehrlich's 1898 paper for originating the concept, which identifies peripheral chemical groups in molecules responsible for binding that leads to the subsequent biological effect, and to Schueler's 1960 book that extends the concept to the modern definition where spatial patterns of abstract features of a molecule define the pharmacophore and are ultimately responsible for the biological effect. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Structure-based pharmacophore models of a ligand in complex with a protein have proven to be useful for supporting in silico hit discovery, hit to lead expansion, and lead optimization. As a structure-based approach it depends on the correct interpretation of ligand-protein interactions. There are legitimate concerns about the fidelity of the bound ligand and about non-physiological contacts with parts of the crystal and the solvent effects that influence the protein structure. A possible way to refine the structure of a protein-ligand system is to use the final structure of a given MD simulation. In this study we compare pharmacophore models built using the initial protein-ligand structure obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) with pharmacophore models built with the final structure of a molecular dynamics simulation. We show that the pharmacophore models differ in feature number and feature type and that the pharmacophore models built from the last structure of a MD simulation shows in some cases better ability to distinguish between active and decoy ligand structures.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that pharmacophores retrieved from protein-ligand molecular dynamic trajectories outperform pharmacophores retrieved from a single crystal complex structure. However, the number of retrieved pharmacophores can be enormous, thus, making it computationally inefficient to use all of them for virtual screening. In this study, we proposed selection of distinct representative pharmacophores by the removal of pharmacophores with identical three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore hashes. We also proposed a new conformer coverage approach in order to rank compounds using all representative pharmacophores. Our results for four cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complexes with different ligands demonstrated that the proposed selection and ranking approaches outperformed the previously described common hits approach. We also demonstrated that ranking, based on averaged predicted scores obtained from different complexes, can outperform ranking based on scores from an individual complex.

    abstract = "Molecular dynamics simulation generates large quantities of data that must be interpreted using physically meaningful analysis. A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states. As test systems microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the polyalanines Ala(8) and Ala(12) are analyzed. Both systems clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov model. This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the kinetics obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, clustering based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived metastable states or a reliable Markov model. Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of networks, each having a different number of metastable states. The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of biomolecules.",

    abstract = "Virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) in drug discovery is a powerful approach to identify hits: when applied successfully, it can be much faster and cheaper than experimental high-throughput screening approaches. However, mainstream vHTS tools have significant limitations: ligand-based methods depend on knowledge of existing chemical matter, while structure-based tools such as docking involve significant approximations that limit their accuracy. Recent advances in scientific methods coupled with dramatic speedups in computational processing with GPUs make this an opportune time to consider the role of more rigorous methods that could improve the predictive power of vHTS workflows. In this Perspective, we assert that alchemical binding free energy methods using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have matured to the point where they can be applied in virtual screening campaigns as a final scoring stage to prioritize the top molecules for experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations offer the most direct and computationally efficient approach within a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework for computing binding energies of diverse molecules, as is required for virtual screening. ABFE calculations are particularly attractive for drug discovery at this point in time, where the confluence of large-scale genomics data and insights from chemical biology have unveiled a large number of promising disease targets for which no small molecule binders are known, precluding ligand-based approaches, and where traditional docking approaches have foundered to find progressible chemical matter.",

    abstract = "Virtual screening is a widely used strategy in modern drug discovery and 2D fingerprint similarity is an important tool that has been successfully applied to retrieve active compounds from large datasets. However, it is not always straightforward to select an appropriate fingerprint method and associated settings for a given problem. Here, we applied eight different fingerprint methods, as implemented in the new cheminformatics package Canvas, on a well-validated dataset covering five targets. The fingerprint methods include Linear, Dendritic, Radial, MACCS, MOLPRINT2D, Pairwise, Triplet, and Torsion. We find that most fingerprints have similar retrieval rates on average; however, each has special characteristics that distinguish its performance on different query molecules and ligand sets. For example, some fingerprints exhibit a significant ligand size dependency whereas others are more robust with respect to variations in the query or active compounds. In cases where little information is known about the active ligands, MOLPRINT2D fingerprints produce the highest average retrieval actives. When multiple queries are available, we find that a fingerprint averaged over all query molecules is generally superior to fingerprints derived from single queries. Finally, a complementarity metric is proposed to determine which fingerprint methods can be combined to improve screening results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

    abstract = "We present a new approach that incorporates flexibility based on extensive MD simulations of protein-ligand complexes into structure-based pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening. The approach uses the multiple coordinate sets saved during the MD simulations and generates for each frame a pharmacophore model. Pharmacophore models with the same pharmacophore features are pooled. In this way the high number of pharmacophore models that results from the MD simulation is reduced to only a few hundred representative pharmacophore models. Virtual screening runs are performed with every representative pharmacophore model; the screening results are combined and rescored to generate a single hit-list. The score for a particular molecule is calculated based on the number of representative pharmacophore models which classified it as active. Hence, the method is called common hits approach (CHA). The steps between the MD simulation and the final hit-list are performed automatically and without user interaction. We test the performance of CHA for virtual screening using screening databases with active and inactive compounds for 40 protein-ligand systems. The results of the CHA are compared to the (i) median screening performance of all representative pharmacophore models of protein-ligand systems, as well as to the virtual screening performance of (ii) a random classifier, (iii) the pharmacophore model derived from the experimental structure in the PDB, and (iv) the representative pharmacophore model appearing most frequently during the MD simulation. For the 34 (out of 40) protein-ligand complexes, for which at least one of the approaches was able to perform better than a random classifier, the highest enrichment was achieved using CHA in 68{\\%} of the cases, compared to 12{\\%} for the PDB pharmacophore model and 20{\\%} for the representative pharmacophore model appearing most frequently. The availabilithy of diverse sets of different pharmacophore models is utilized to analyze some additional questions of interest in 3D pharmacophore-based virtual screening.",

In total, 157-872 virtual screens were performed to assess the ability of each combination of parameters to identify actives in a database screen. In general, fingerprint methods, such as MOLPRINT2D, Radial, and Dendritic that encode information about local environment beyond simple linear paths outperformed other fingerprint methods. Atom-typing schemes with more specific information, such as Daylight, Mol2, and Carhart were generally superior to more generic atom-typing schemes. Enrichment factors across all targets were improved considerably with the best settings, although no single set of parameters performed optimally on all targets. The size of the addressable bit space for the fingerprints was also explored, and it was found to have a substantial impact on enrichments. Small bit spaces, such as 1024, resulted in many collisions and in a significant degradation in enrichments compared to larger bit spaces that avoid collisions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.",

The determination of the conformers of a protein and their basins of attraction takes a central role for studying molecular isomerization reactions. In this work, we present a novel framework to unveil the features of a Free Energy Landscape answering questions such as how many meta-stable conformers there are, what the hierarchical relationship among them is, or what the structure and kinetics of the transition paths are. Exploring the landscape by molecular dynamics simulations, the microscopic data of the trajectory are encoded into a Conformational Markov Network. The structure of this graph reveals the regions of the conformational space corresponding to the basins of attraction. In addition, handling the Conformational Markov Network, relevant kinetic magnitudes as dwell times and rate constants, or hierarchical relationships among basins, completes the global picture of the landscape. We show the power of the analysis studying a toy model of a funnel-like potential and computing efficiently the conformers of a short peptide, dialanine, paving the way to a systematic study of the Free Energy Landscape in large peptides.",

We test it on multiple simplified potentials and in a protein folding scenario. We find that this framework performs similarly or better in every type of test potentials compared to previous methods.

Such a transition network, which overcomes the fundamental limitations of reaction-coordinate-based methods, can be constructed either based on the features of the energy landscape, or from molecular dynamics simulations. Energy-landscape-based networks are generated with the aid of automated path-optimization methods, and, using graph-theoretical adaptive methods, can now be constructed for large molecules such as proteins. Dynamics-based networks, also called Markov State Models, can be interpreted and adaptively improved using statistical concepts, such as the mean first passage time, reactive flux and sampling error analysis.

    abstract = {We have recently presented a new pharmacophore design method that allows for the incorporation of the inherent flexibility of a target active site. The flexibility of the enzymatic system is described by collecting many conformations of the uncomplexed protein; this ensemble of conformational states can come from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, multiple crystal structures, or many NMR structures. Binding sites for functional groups that complement the active site are determined through multiple-copy calculations. These calculations are conducted for each protein conformation, providing a large collection of potential binding sites. The Cartesian coordinates from each protein conformation are overlaid through RMS fitting of essential catalytic residues, and the pharmacophore model is described by binding regions that are conserved over many protein conformations. Previously, we developed a "dynamic" pharmacophore model for HIV-1 integrase using 11 conformations of the protein from an MD simulation; the MUSIC procedure was used to calculate binding positions for methanol molecules in each configuration of the active site. Here we present "static" pharmacophore models developed with a single conformation of the protein from two new crystal structures (standard protocol for multiple-copy methods). The static models do not perform as well as the previous dynamic model in fitting known inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase. To test the applicability of the dynamic pharmacophore method and the assumption that any reliable source of protein conformations is applicable, we have now developed a second dynamic pharmacophore model based on the two crystal structures also used for the development of the static models. Though the dynamic model based on the two crystal structures does not fit as many known inhibitors as the previous dynamic model, it is a significant improvement over the static models. Even better performance is expected with the addition of new crystal structures as they become available. However, it is notable that using only two structures leads to great improvement in the models. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Chemical Society.},
