# Bibliography norms and rules

- Avoid the use of directories and folders to categorize a paper. Use keywords to tag it instead.
- Use directories and folder to build paper collections, not to categorize the content of a paper.
  For example, when you write a manuscript put all citable papers in a folder, when you work in a
project or in a collaboration where you have to keep track of the manuscripts shared or read. 

# Tagging papers

Find the list of recommended tags in the file `tags.txt`.

When using specific tags such as:

binding free energy methods
protein solvation free energy
lipid coarse grained models
alchemical free energy methods
absolute binding free energy
targeting gpcrs

Try to encode de concept with the right combination of key words found in `tags.txt`.

binding free energy methods ---> binding; free; energy; methods;
protein solvation free energy ---> proteins; solvation; free; energy;
lipid coarse grained models ---> lipids; coarse grained; models;
alchemical free energy methods ---> alchemistry; free; energy; methods;
absolute binding free energy ---> absolute; binding; free; energy;
targeting gpcrs ---> targeting; gpcr
